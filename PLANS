Ideas for progress:

Step 1: Set up instructions for users to apply if they want to modify
a source package from their distribution. Like a HOWTO.

Step 2: Create a shell scripts that will download a package and build
it, to the point where modifying the source code and doing "make install"
is possible. This script should have a distribution-agnostic human
interface.

Step 3: Create ready-made buildballs for a couple of common distributions
and make them available for download.

Step 4: Standardize the format of these buildball download sites and
convince distributors to provide them themselves.
