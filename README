The BuildBalls project will make it easier for end users of common
distributions to create, test, and install modifications of packages.
In the beginning, it might only provide documentation of how to do this.
Later, it might distribute tarballs of build trees, where changing the
source code and doing "make install" is possible.

For packages that are standalone programs with few dependencies, few
configuration options, and few distributor patches, the user can
download the source code and build it for himself. But for the majority
of packages (think of Qt, X11, Firefox, VLC), it is hardly practical
any more. Yet, software development speed and quality depend on users
contributing to it.
